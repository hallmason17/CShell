# CShell

A basic shell in C.
Will slowly be adding more builtins and functionality.

## Motivation

This is a favorite type of software of mine to build and I want to build it in a few systems languages to pick my favorite.

## Description

A basic shell written in C.

## Quick Start

Install git, make, and gcc.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hallmason17/CShell.git

./a.out
```
